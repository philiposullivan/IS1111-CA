Core Implementation (40%) 2D list correctly implemented. List methods (append, remove, index, pop) used appropriately. Menu-driven interface complete (implemented as a separate function that is called from the main loop). All required operations present.	Excellent: 2D list is correctly implemented and consistently structured across all operations. List methods (append, remove, index, pop) are used appropriately and efficiently throughout. Menu-driven interface is complete with all options working correctly. All required operations (view inventory, add product, update stock, remove product, view low stock, calculate inventory value) are present and demonstrate comprehensive mastery of list manipulation.	Very Good: 2D list is correctly implemented with good structure. List methods are used appropriately in most cases. Menu-driven interface includes all required options with minor issues. All required operations are present with a strong grasp of list manipulation, well supported by correct implementation.	Good: 2D list is implemented with occasional structural issues. List methods are used but sometimes inefficiently. Menu-driven interface includes most required options. Most required operations are present with an acceptable grasp of the material, though some minor errors appear.	Satisfactory: 2D list is implemented but sometimes loses logical structure. List methods are used with some errors. Menu-driven interface is mostly complete but lacking detail. Basic grasp of list operations demonstrated, but only basic understanding portrayed with several minor errors.	Acceptable: 2D list is poorly structured with limited focus on correct implementation. List methods are underused or misused. Menu-driven interface is incomplete. Basic grasp of subject matter but unclear implementation with some omissions or inaccuracies.	Fail: 2D list is not implemented or fundamentally broken. No understanding of list methods demonstrated. Menu system is absent or non-functional. Required operations are missing. Deficient understanding displayed with programme that does not run due to major issues.

Data Processing and Calculations (25%) Total inventory value calculated correctly. Low stock identification working. Loop iteration through lists correct. Input validation implemented.	Excellent: Total inventory value is calculated correctly using proper loop iteration. Low stock identification correctly compares quantities against minimum thresholds. All loops iterate through lists correctly with proper index management. Input validation prevents all invalid entries with clear, actionable error messages. Demonstrates excellent ability to implement data processing logic and calculations.	Very Good: Total inventory value calculation is correct with good loop usage. Low stock identification works correctly for most cases. Loops iterate through lists correctly with minor issues. Input validation handles most common invalid entries. Demonstrates well-developed capacity to implement data processing logic and calculations.	Good: Total inventory value calculation works with minor errors. Low stock identification works but may miss edge cases. Loops generally work but may have occasional iteration issues. Input validation handles basic invalid entries. Demonstrates acceptable grasp of data processing logic and calculations with some lack of fluency.	Satisfactory: Total inventory value calculation has noticeable errors. Low stock identification is unreliable. Loops have some iteration problems. Input validation is minimal. Demontrates basic understanding of data processing logic and calculations but lacking detail and containing several minor errors.	Acceptable: Total inventory value calculation has significant errors. Low stock identification works inconsistently. Loops have frequent problems. Input validation is inconsistent. Demontrates basic grasp of data processing logic and calculations but limited focus on correct implementation.	Fail: Total inventory value calculation is incorrect or missing. Low stock identification does not work or is missing. Loops fail to iterate correctly. Input validation is absent. Programme crashes with unexpected input. Wholly unacceptable with deficient understanding of data processing logic and calculations.

Code Organisation and Style (15%) Code organised into functions. Meaningful variable names. Code follows PEP 8 conventions. Appropriate use of comments.	Excellent: Code is excellently organised into well-defined functions, each handling a single task. All variable and function names are meaningful and follow Python conventions (snake_case); function names include a verb. Code fully adheres to PEP 8 conventions. Demonstrates excellent ability to organise and structure code logically.	Very Good: Good use of functions with mostly clear separation of tasks. Most variable and function names are meaningful and follow conventions; verbs are missing from some function names. Code mostly adheres to PEP 8 conventions. Demonstrates well-developed capacity to organise code with clear structure.	Good: Adequate use of functions with some mixing of tasks. Variable names are generally meaningful with some poor choices; verbs are missing from most function names. Code partially adheres to PEP 8. Demonstrates acceptable code organisation but some lack of structure and consistency.	Satisfactory: Limited use of functions with poor separation of tasks. Variable names are often unclear; verbs are missing from function names. Code has multiple PEP 8 violations. Demonstrates basic code structure but somewhat lacking organisation.	Acceptable: Functions are not used effectively. Variable names are often meaningless. Code ignores PEP 8 conventions. Unclear organisation with random layout.	Fail: No functional organisation. Code is unstructured. Variable names make code unreadable. No adherence to any coding standards. Random and undisciplined code organisation without any structure.

Documentation and Self-Reflection (20%) Header comment complete. Inline comments explain code. Docstrings for all functions. Self-reflection statement included. AI usage properly disclosed.	Excellent: Header comment includes all required elements (filename, name, student ID, date, description). Inline comments effectively explain code logic without over-commenting. All functions have clear, informative docstrings. Self-reflection statement demonstrates comprehensive engagement with learning outcomes. AI usage (if any) is thoroughly documented with prompts, critical evaluation and working links; or explicit statement that no AI was used.	Very Good: Header comment includes most required elements. Inline comments explain most sections well. Most functions have good docstrings. Self-reflection describes learning with some original insights. AI usage is well documented, but links don't work, or AI is clearly stated as not used.	Good: Header comment includes basic elements. Inline comments are present but may be unclear. Some functions have docstrings. Self-reflection is present but ideas stated rather than developed. AI usage is documented but insufficiently detailed.	Satisfactory: Header comment is incomplete. Inline comments are minimal. Few functions have docstrings. Self-reflection is basic with only some engagement displayed. AI usage documentation is incomplete.	Acceptable: Header comment is missing key elements. No meaningful inline comments. No docstrings present. Self-reflection is superficial. AI usage poorly documented.	Fail: No documentation present. No header, comments, or docstrings. No self-reflection. AI usage is undisclosed or misrepresented.
