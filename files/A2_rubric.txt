| **Excellent** | 25 | Category report demonstrates excellent dictionary usage. Creates appropriate data structures for grouped information. Correctly counts products per category and calculates total values. All calculations accurate. Report displays clearly. All 5 new functions integrate seamlessly with provided code. Student code does not modify or delete provided functions. Sample data initialisation works correctly. Transaction logging integrated properly. Programme runs without errors. |
| **Very Good** | 22 | Category report shows good dictionary usage with minor issues. Creates data structures correctly. Counts and calculates with minor inaccuracies. Report displays well. All functions integrate with provided code. No modification of provided functions. Sample data works. Transaction logging integrated. Minor integration issues that don't prevent operation. |
| **Good** | 17 | Category report demonstrates acceptable dictionary usage with some issues. Data structures created with some problems. Counts or calculations have noticeable errors. Report displays adequately. Most functions integrate with provided code. Minimal or no modification of provided functions. Sample data mostly works. Transaction logging mostly integrated. Programme runs but may have some errors. |
| **Satisfactory** | 14 | Category report attempts dictionary operations but has significant issues. Data structures incomplete or flawed. Calculations unreliable. Report displays poorly. Some integration problems. May have modified provided functions slightly. Sample data issues. Transaction logging incomplete. Programme runs but has errors. |
| **Acceptable** | 12 | Category report has major errors. Poor data structures. Major calculation errors. Minimal display. Poor integration. Provided functions modified. Sample data problems. Limited transaction logging. Many errors when running. |
| **Fail** | 9 | Category report missing or completely wrong. No appropriate data structures. No calculations. No integration. Provided functions deleted or heavily modified. Programme crashes or doesn't run. |

## CRITERION 3: Code Organisation and Style (15%)

### What's being assessed:
- Five new functions well organised with clear separation from provided code
- Meaningful variable names
- Code follows PEP 8 conventions

### Grade descriptors:

| Grade | Marks | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Excellent** | 15 | All 5 new functions excellently organised, each handling a single task. Clear separation from provided code. Logical structure within each function. All variable and function names meaningful and follow Python conventions (snake_case). Code fully adheres to PEP 8 conventions. |
| **Very Good** | 13 | Good use of 4-5 functions with clear separation of tasks. Good separation from provided code. Most variable and function names meaningful and follow conventions. Code mostly adheres to PEP 8 conventions. |
| **Good** | 10 | Adequate use of 3-4 functions. Some separation from provided code. Variable names generally meaningful with some poor choices. Code partially adheres to PEP 8. |
| **Satisfactory** | 9 | Limited use of 2-3 functions with poor separation of tasks. Poor separation from provided code. Variable names often unclear. Code has multiple PEP 8 violations. |
| **Acceptable** | 7 | 1-2 functions not used effectively. Minimal separation from provided code. Variable names often meaningless. Code ignores PEP 8 conventions. Unclear code organisation. |
| **Fail** | 6 | No functional organisation. New code mixed randomly with provided code or provided functions modified/deleted. Variable names make code unreadable. No adherence to coding standards. |

## QUICK REFERENCE: What each function must do

| Function | Key Requirements |
|----------|------------------|
| `generate_product_id(inventory)` | Return "P001" if empty; otherwise find highest existing ID number, add 1, format as "P" + 3 zero-padded digits |
| `search_products(inventory)` | Ask user for (N)ame or (C)ategory; name search = partial match, case-insensitive; category search = exact match, case-insensitive; display formatted results with count |
| `log_transaction(transactions, trans_type, product_id, product_name, quantity)` | Create transaction dict with type, product_id, product_name, quantity, timestamp (ISO format); append to transactions list |
| `view_transaction_log(transactions, num_recent=10)` | Display most recent transactions (newest first); format timestamp as "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"; show quantity with +/- sign |
| `generate_category_report(inventory)` | Group products by category; count products and sum value (price × quantity) per category; display formatted report with totals; return the category data dict |
